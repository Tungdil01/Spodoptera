To document results and for the sake of reproducibility, we use `jupyter notebook`s. We provide a `requirements.txt` file in case you want to have the same
development environment we have (for instance, you can create an environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)). We use `Python >= 3.6`.

## Required packages
For the utilized packages, see the [requirements](https://github.com/Tungdil01/Spodoptera/blob/main/requirements.txt).
